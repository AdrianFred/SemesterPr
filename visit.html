                <h3>Volenteer</h3>
                <p>A number of people volunteer their time and effort 
                    to keep the displays in good order and ready for 
                    visitors to come and enjoy. Volunteering has its 
                    perks including getting to see behind the scenes of 
                    a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, 
                    and a monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers 
                    come together to discuss ideas for future exhibits 
                    and strategies for the museum.
                    You can help volunteer in a number of different 
                    spheres. Please contact us if you’d like to find out 
                    more about how you can get involved.
