We had a semester project in our Front-end Development course at Noroff, where we were asked to create a website for "Community Science Museum"

## Description

This website is made for the Museum to let kids/teachers and people in general read about the museum and what they offer.
We're trying to let people and specially kids, get involved with the museum and learn stuff about different topics.

Some of the main aspect of the site:

- A home page with a CTA button, where we have some text that wants the users to look more into the site.
- A visit page with the information about where the musuem is, and the admission to enter it. We also show the opening and serving hours.
- A page with different exhibition spaces where they can quickly and easily read about the different topics we offer.
- Events where we show upcoming things and shows thats gonna happen at the museum.

## Built With

- To make this page we used basic HTML/CSS. No java script or anything as everything was hardcoded, this was our first big project at our school.
- To deply the website we used [Netlify](www.Netlify.com)

## Getting Started

### Installing

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AdrianFred/SemesterPr.git

To run this website locally you can just open it in VSC and run it through the liveserver plugin.
